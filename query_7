select product_name as products_name, unit_price

	 order by unit_price desc;
   -- this solution is an answer to not being able to use the 'limit' or the
   --'fetch only' operators in sql since they do not exist in relational
   --algebra and thus cannot be used, note that this is only the first half
   --of the query
--ps: upon further inspection, this turned out to be utterly retarded.
